## Inspiration

Since we are just booking a skiing trip and it's super cumbersome, we tried to reinvent this process. That's why we built Bay´n´B. 

## What it does

It takes over the whole process of booking a trip. It suggests you an accommodation, a form of transportation and possible activities for your given preferences. You can then book those with just a few clicks.
Thus, we replace travel agencies and make the whole process of booking a trip a lot easier.

## How we built it

We built an IOS App which uses API´s to gather information from different sources and merges them into one booking process.

## Challenges we ran into

Sadly you need for nearly all transportation companies API keys, so we were not able to connect to those in this short amount of time. Since we are just 2 team members the project size was kind of overwhelming, which is why some detail views are missing. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The idea!! And of course we are happy about our MVP, we are going to present. It's incredible what you can built in just a few hours of coding.

## What's next for Bay´n´B

Bay´n´B should get a whole network for booking activities. Activity providers should be able to offer their services in our app and make the booking process for those a lot easier. 
User´s should be able to search for all possible activities and book these with transport and accommodation in just a few clicks. The booking process should be able through Siri, to make it even easier.
A model should be trained to react to overbooking and suggest alternative destinations.
An "In-Activity-Navigation" should be added to take even more care of capacity problems: e.g. suggest a different slope or hiking path to offer the best experience.
